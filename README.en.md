## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory, and then in both the back-end and front-end directories respectively.

   **RECOMMENDATION**: Use 2 split terminals, one for the back end and one for the front end...

3. In the back-end section `back/config/`, you will find a file named `.env.example`. Rename this file to `.env` and provide valid environment variables.
4. In the terminal dedicated to the back end, run `npm start` to start the server.
5. In the terminal dedicated to the front end, run `npm run dev` to view the front end. (In the terminal, you will see localhost:3000; you can access the front end by `ctrl + click` on the link).
